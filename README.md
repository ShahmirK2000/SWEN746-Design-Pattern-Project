# SWEN746-Design-Pattern-Project
A small project for SWEN746: Model-Driven Development

##Factory Design Pattern
The first design pattern I chose to implement is the factory design pattern. Its goal is to create an outline of objects, that subclasses can produce. The parent interface, or abstract class, may not know exactly how to implement certain objects, so child classes can implement them exactly how they want to. I used this design pattern to create a simple arena with 4 types of characters. I simulated a battle between the 4, with attributes (buffs/debuffs) to each class.
