# SWEN746-Design-Pattern-Project
A small project for SWEN746: Model-Driven Development

## Factory Design Pattern
The first design pattern I chose to implement is the factory design pattern. Its goal is to create an outline of objects, that subclasses can produce. The parent interface, or abstract class, may not know exactly how to implement certain objects, so child classes can implement them exactly how they want to. I used this design pattern to create a simple arena with 4 types of characters. I simulated a battle between the 4, with attributes (buffs/debuffs) to each class.

## Strategy Design Pattern
The second design pattern I chose to implement is the strategy design pattern. Its goal is to allow the designer to define a family of algorithms and put them into their own separate class, which makes their objects interchangeable. I used this design pattern to create a simple shopping interface that allows the user to pick which payment option (strategy) they would like to use.
